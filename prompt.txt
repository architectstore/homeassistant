You are generating Home Assistant YAML automations to control a Zendure SolarFlow 800 Pro via entities exposed in Home Assistant. The goal is to keep my phase A grid power close to 0 W (±50 W) by dynamically adjusting discharge and AC charging, and to keep the battery idle at night.

Entities:
- Grid reference (phase A): sensor.shelly_phase_a_power
  - Unit: W
  - Sign convention: positive = importing from grid, negative = exporting to grid.
- Battery SoC: sensor.eoa1nhn3n259185_electriclevel (0–100 %)
- Discharge/output limit (0–800 W): number.solarflow_discharge_limit
- AC charge power limit (0–1000 W): number.solarflow_ac_charge_limit

Constraints:
- Max discharge power: 800 W
- Max AC charge power: 1000 W
- Discharge only if SoC > SOC_DISCHARGE_MIN (use 25)
- Charge only if SoC < SOC_CHARGE_MAX (use 90)
- Control window (day): from 08:00 to 23:00
- Night window: from 23:00 to 08:00, SolarFlow must stay idle (no charge, no discharge).

Control rules:
1. If time is between 23:00 and 08:00:
   - Always set number.solarflow_discharge_limit = 0
   - Always set number.solarflow_ac_charge_limit = 0
   - Do not change limits based on grid power at night.

2. During the day (08:00–23:00):
   - If abs(sensor.shelly_phase_a_power) <= 50:
       - Set both limits to 0 (no charge, no discharge).
   - If sensor.shelly_phase_a_power > 50 and SOC > SOC_DISCHARGE_MIN:
       - Compute P_discharge = min(800, sensor.shelly_phase_a_power - 50)
       - Set number.solarflow_discharge_limit = P_discharge
       - Set number.solarflow_ac_charge_limit = 0
   - If sensor.shelly_phase_a_power < -50 and SOC < SOC_CHARGE_MAX:
       - Compute P_charge = min(1000, abs(sensor.shelly_phase_a_power) - 50)
       - Set number.solarflow_ac_charge_limit = P_charge
       - Set number.solarflow_discharge_limit = 0

YAML best practices:
- Use hysteresis via the ±50 W deadband and an optional input_number to avoid sending new setpoints when the change is smaller than 50 W.
- Comment the YAML clearly so I can adjust thresholds later.
